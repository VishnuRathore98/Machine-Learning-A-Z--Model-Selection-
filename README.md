## Machine Learning (Model Selection)

This repository contains code and resources for the "Model Selection" of  Machine Learning.

**Topics Covered:**

* **K-Fold Cross Validation:** A technique for evaluating model performance by splitting the data into multiple folds and training/testing on different combinations.
* **Grid Search:** A method for finding the optimal hyperparameters for a model by systematically trying different combinations.
* **Random Search:** A more efficient approach to hyperparameter tuning that randomly samples from the parameter space.
* **Ensemble Methods:** Combining multiple models to improve prediction accuracy.
* **Feature Selection:** Identifying the most relevant features for a given task.

**Code Examples:**

* **K-Fold Cross Validation:** `kfold_cross_validation.py`
* **Grid Search:** `grid_search.py`
* **Random Search:** `random_search.py`
* **Ensemble Methods:** `ensemble_methods.py`
* **Feature Selection:** `feature_selection.py`

**Resources:**

* **Scikit-learn Documentation:** [https://scikit-learn.org/stable/](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas, numpy).
3. Run the code examples to explore the different model selection techniques.


```python
# Import libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data.
